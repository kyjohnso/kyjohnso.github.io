        <h2>AI Alignment Fundamentals Course</h2>
        <p> I recently completed Blue Dot Impact's <a href="https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/alignment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI Alignment</a>. 
            In this course we are exposed to a wide variety of AI alignment techniques, ideas, and research approaches. In the final third of the course, I completed
            a project in Computable Policy and World Model integration. You can find the post for this project at 
            <a href="https://hylaeansea.org/blog/2025/02/01/World-Models-and-Language-Models.html"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hylaean Sea</a>. As with all of these projects (it seems) I plan to develop this
            concept more in the future. 
            <img src="./docs/assets/images/New_Knowledge.png" alt="New Knowledge" class="media-image" loading="lazy">
        </p>
        <p> I have also been engaging a local chat group on some high level questions about AI Alignment Philosophy and will be including those prompts here as well.</p>
        <h3>Distribution of AI</h3>
        
        <img src="./docs/assets/images/DALLÂ·E_2025-01-25-tippling_point_s.webp" alt="Tipping Point" class="media-image" loading="lazy">
        <p>A thought I have been pondering recently: assuming the economic, leisure, and cultural benefits of AI are very large (they may not be but lets assume they are), what are the major tipping points or key factors that will determine if these AI resources are concentrated in the hands of a few AI elite, or the AI upper class; or are spread out in society for everyone's benefit? Is it education, fear, use in businesses, open source models, or something else that could make the difference between it being available to the masses vs locked away?</p>
        
        <h3>AI Unlearning</h3>
        
        <img src="./docs/assets/images/DALLE_image_of_AI_removing_knowledge_of_another_AI.webp" alt="Knowledge Removal" class="media-image" loading="lazy">
        <p>There is significant research into AI alignment at the fine-tuning stage. Several techniques attempt to make LLMs forget, or unlearn harmful 
            knowledge that the base model acquired in the training phase on bulk internet data. We try to make it "unlearn" how to make a bomb, or how to 
            make a nerve-agent for example. Is this wise? Don't we want LLMs to have harmful knowledge so that they can recognize it, as it comes up in 
            prompts? Does this have parallels for human knowledge? Is there "harmful knowledge" that we should try to unlearn as a society?</p>


        <h3>Bootstrap Training</h3>
        <p>If we need humans to generate training or fine tuning data to train advanced AI's can they ever become more capable than humans? 
            Can a human train something more cognitively capable than itself? If so, how do we make sure that these more capable AIs are aligned with our goals?

        <h2>Blender Con 2024</h2>
        <p>I was fortunate to have my talk selected for Blender Con 2024. I expected to have just a 20 minute talk but I was slotted for a live 50-minute walkthrough of some of the projects that appear on this page.
            I began with a walkthrough of the geometry nodes approach to modeling parametric surfaces, then demonstrated how to use modifiers and scripting to model the 3D dodecahedron moon.

        <h2>Ideal Gas Simulation</h2>
        <p>My daughter was studying the states of matter in her science class and she had a fairly good grasp of the molecular (non-quantum) mental model of matter and how it translates
            to the physical properties of the material in different states. She, however had a bit of trouble with visualizing why an ideal gas will take the shape of its container. After much
            explaining, pretending we were molecules and dancing around, and throwing fruit off the walls and ceiling of the kitchen, we decided to have chatgpt help us visualize this in 
            a web simulation. The simulation was written in threejs and can be found at <a href="./ideal_gas/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ideal Gas Simulation</a>

        <h2>Frequency Difference</h2>
        <p>
            An exploration of the intersection of quadrics. Frequency difference (doppler difference) from a location to two different moving sensors
            can be modeled as two intersecting cones with related cone angles. Set to the music of Hans Zimmer, it can be quite mesmerizing.
