        <h2>Blender Con 2024</h2>
        <p>I was fortunate enough to give my first presentation at Blender Con 2024 in Amsterdam. I did a live 50-minute walkthrough of some of the projects that appear on this page.
            I began with a walkthrough of the geometry nodes approach to modeling parametric surfaces, then demonstrated how to use modifiers and scripting to model the 3D dodecahedron moon.

        <h2>Ideal Gas Simulation</h2>
        <p>My daughter was studying the states of matter in her science class and she had a fairly good grasp of the molecular (non-quantum) mental model of matter and how it translates
            to the physical properties of the material in different states. She, however had a bit of trouble with visualizing why an ideal gas will take the shape of its container. After much
            explaining, pretending we were molecules and dancing around, and throwing fruit off the walls and ceiling of the kitchen, we decided to have chatgpt help us visualize this in 
            a web simulation. The simulation was written in threejs and can be found at <a href="./ideal_gas/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ideal Gas Simulation</a>

        <h2>Dodecahedron Moon</h2>
        <p>This is a 3D printed design of the moon (real topography from 
        <a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=4720" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NASA Moon Kit</a>) broken 
        into the curved hexagonal faces of a dodecahedron. The whole design is held together by
        force-fit magnets. The full 12 STL files will be posted soon at Printables.</p>

        <h2>Frequency Difference</h2>
        <p>
            An exploration of the intersection of quadrics. Frequency difference (doppler difference) from a location to two different moving sensors
            can be modeled as two intersecting cones with related cone angles. Set to the music of Hans Zimmer, it can be quite mesmerizing.

        <h2>CGI Sandbox</h2>
        <p>
            An exploration of CGI with drone footage. So far done only with Blender motion tracking. Hopefully evolving over the coming months. Drone footage courtesy of my buddy Greg.

        <h2>Intersecting Hyperboloids</h2>
        <p>
            A visualization of two intersecting hyperboloids with one of their foci shared. It is interesting to note that the intersection pencil will always intersect the plane formed by the three foci at a right angle.
